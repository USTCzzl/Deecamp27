This is the Projet to generate the closed boundary of a image
      we have tried many difference methods to slove it
            we did not reach the point we except, but get some results.

we use the pretrained model directly to our project, we get excited at first, Because it gives us a lot of confidence, he has a much better effect than the traditional boundary detect operator(such as Canny, Sobel), and it is also firm that we use a learning-based approach to solve the problem.Results are as follows:
